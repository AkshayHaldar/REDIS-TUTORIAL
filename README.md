Redis - Remote Dictionary Server . Built by Salvatore Sanfilippo (known as antirez) in 2009. **Redis Labs** (Formally known as **Garantia Data**) , is the organisation which maintains redis.

# Major changes in 2024 💡
Maybe some of us has got a recent spiced up news of redis's sudden license change which created an internal conflict within the organisation. Redis changed its previous license **BSD 3-Clause Model** to **Dual-License Model** (Interested Peeps can check out this news on web). What this change caused , is a born of a new project - **Valkey** (supported by Linux Foundation also)

# Linux vs Valkey ⚡
Developers who built redis under previous license came in **Valkey**. Redis under BSD , was maintained  till version 7.4x (7.4.6) which ended in October 2024. From November 2024 , Redis 8.0x series started which obeys Dual-License . On the other hand , Valkey started from v7.5x by the OG developers of redis , under BSD license.
