# REDIS HASHES
Hash - mapping a value to a field (not key ðŸ˜‰) . It differs in the line where HASH is just a DS which perfectly resembles with java hashmap , python dict and ruby dict , whereas redis' key-value pair is the only way to store data of any data-structure it follows.

Hashes in Redis , gives a little bit feeling of a db . That's why , Redis-OM uses HashModel as their data model to store data in redis.

To use Hashing , we need a hash-index which will hold the keys and values , or we can say under the hash-index , the keys will be linked to seperate values

# Commmands

  - ## HGET & HSET
    Set a Hash-Key or Field using HSET . Fetch its value using HGET 
    
    ```bash
       127.0.0.1:6379> HSET car:1 model "lamborgini" color "green" engine "XOG Bullseye" available 10  # 'car:1' is hash-index
       (integer) 4
       127.0.0.1:6379> HGET car:1 model # 'model' is key
       "lamborgini"
    ```
  - ## HGETALL
    Just fetches all keys (not values) of a certain hash-index

    ```bash
       127.0.0.1:6379> HGETALL car:1
       1) "model"
       2) "lamborgini"
       3) "color"
       4) "green"
       5) "engine"
       6) "XOG Bullseye"
       7) "available"
       8) "10"
    ```
